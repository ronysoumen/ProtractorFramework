Here are the following things which can come into my mind which could help you setup your framework-

IDE: Download the latest VS Code version - https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Install typescript globally:  npm install -g typescript

Install protractor globally: npm install -g protractor


Create your project folder: e.g. nsWeb
Setup your project folder for node and typescript:

npm init -f  // will create default package.json stating its nodejs project 
tsc --init    // will create tsconfig.json stating its typescript project


Install typings and dev dependencies-
npm install --save-dev protractor // this will install protractor as a dev dependency
npm install --save-dev typescript // this will install typescript as a dev dependency
npm install --save-dev @types/jasmine // jasmine typings
npm install --save-dev @types/node     // node typings


At this point you have setup your basic protractor-typescript project and you can see all the typings and dependencies in package.json. Now you are good to write your typed scripts :).

Now compile your scripts by running:(Converting .ts files to .js files)
tsc or tsc -w


After successful compilation all your JavaScript files would be generated.


Run Protractor : protractor conf.js
